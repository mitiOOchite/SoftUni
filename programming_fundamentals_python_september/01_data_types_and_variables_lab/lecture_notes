                                                        Data Types
string - text
number - int(whole numbers), float(real numbers 1.0),complex(complex numbers), decimal - used for financial calculations (e.g 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1)
boolean - true/false
Additional data types:
list = [123,'Mitko','Joro','Niki']
set
tuple
dictionary = {'name':'Amy','age':10}   -- they have a key and a value
               key  value

Variables are dynamic:
they can be assigned and re-assigned with values, they are not static

var = 42 - var is an int
var = 'bar' var is a string
var = True var is now a boolean

isinstance function - built in returns True or False
def isinstance(x, A_tuple): # real signature unknown; restored from __doc__
    Return whether an object is an instance of a class or of a subclass thereof.
    A tuple, as in ``isinstance(x, (A, B, ...))``, may be given as the target to
    check against. This is equivalent to ``isinstance(x, A) or isinstance(x, B)
    or ...`` etc.
        pass

def - we define a function

                                                             What is a string?
represents textual data
strings in Python are immutable - once created IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MODIFY IT - we can use .replace function and assign a new value to the variable

each element in the string has a position in the string - we can check it with indexing by using square brackets [] and checking positions
the first element is index 0, we always start from 0
the length of a string is the numbers of elements in it - we can use len() to see the number of characters
we can use either double or single quotes, but if we want to write You're we can use backslashes to escape the end of the string or use double quoutes
print("You're")
print('You/re')

                                                                What is an int?
 whole number - positive or negative without decimals, of unlimited length
 python integers are immutable!

                                                                What is a float?
 Floating point real number positive or negative, with a decimal point of unlimited length
 float is immutable

                                                                What are booleans
 bool hold a True or False value, empty, none values and zero are considered are False if we check whether they have values

                                                                What is a set?
splits the value and removes duplicates and holds only the unique value
                                                                What is a list?
items separated by a comma and enclosed with square brackets
lists are mutable
